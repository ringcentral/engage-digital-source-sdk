The simplest way to integrate your Wordpress blog with Dimelo's SMCC.

== Description ==

The SMCC SDK is an easy way for any content provider to integrate his data into our application: Dimelo SMCC.
Agents and community managers using the SMCC will be able to interact in an efficient and trackable way with the
content provider and benefit from all SMCC features (autocategorization, knowledge database, reporting, ...).

If you are interested in developing a client for our SDK and you want to have a method to test your implementation,
you will first need to speak to us. This way we'll be able to provide you with a test domain of the SMCC.
